# Firefox GPT Sidebar

Creating a GPT sidebar addon for Firefox. I haven't created a browser addon before so this is a learning experience for me.

As a starting point, my goals are to:

- Create a sidebar that can be toggled on/off
- Select text from the page and be able to interact with it in the sidebar
